So starting this year I am planning to write a weekly log of how the week has been and any other interesting things that are worth sharing overall. I have been wanting to write a technical blog since long but I have been limited by lethargy most of the time and being busy a few other times. I have been hesitant to do something of this sort because I am afraid of not being consistent in posting things. Atleast I am taking the first leap now and it took 2025 to do that, fingers crossed.
